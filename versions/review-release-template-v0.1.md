[This template can be used for recording the release of a stats product. It marks the point in time and the status of the product. While this is a release notification, the reviewers involved in the review process are expected to go and check the product to ensure that the feedback was captured correctly. If not, reviewers can follow up with the author to work through the critique and then the author might need to reissue another review update and/or then release notification. ]
