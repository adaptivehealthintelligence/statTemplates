## **Review Summary**

### Specific comments

None

### General comments

+ [MJ] Import the repo to the Adaptive Health Intelligence site (https://github.com/adaptivehealthintelligence) to become the primary url referenced in sop
+ [MJ] Provide draft sop document referencing these templates and their usage
+ [JM] Add vignette to detail the kind of things that would be addressed in the context of reviewing sap
+ [TS] As has been noted in the package vignette, google type docs with simultaneous edits do not fit well within this framework but that is acceptable as these are primarily used for proposals and ad-hoc documentation.
+ [JM] Add words into the sop and vignette on process about when this process should/must
+ [TS] Make naming conventions consistent existent sop.
